# Retinex-Image-Enhancement
Implemented image enhancement algorithms like SSR, MSR, MSRCR, etc which removes a layer of illumination from the given image, thereby improving the contrast in an image. Various algorithm were compared and an approach was proposed which showed some promising results.

## Software Requirements
This project requires the MATLAB software to run.

## Results
Based on the comparison of the entropy values of results, the proposed algorithm seemed quite effective.
